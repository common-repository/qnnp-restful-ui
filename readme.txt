Use the UI interface to test WP-JSON friendly.

== Description ==

Use the UI interface to test WP-JSON friendly.
Please make sure your custom route is registered with the namespace!

There is the json content of the entire WP-JSON at the bottom of the plug-in page to prevent you from not being able to find the routing endpoint you need.

There is an original description under each parameter field of the end point.

Except for GET requests, a batch tab will be provided under the request panel.

== Screenshots ==

1. Simple Test
2. Routes List
3. Friendly WP_JSON Root Render
